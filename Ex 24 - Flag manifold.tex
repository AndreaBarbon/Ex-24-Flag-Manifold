\section{Part A}
Let $E,F \in \mathpzc{F} $. We can find some linear basis $e_j,f_j$ s.t. 
$$ E_j = \text{span}(e_j) \AND F_j = \text{span}(f_j) $$
and the map $ g $ defined by $e_j \mapsto f_j$ is an element of $G$, and has the property that $ g\cdot E=F $. We therefore see that the action of $\alpha$ is transitive.

\section{Part B}
From what we saw in Part A it is clear that the stabilizer is given by $$ P=\{ \text{diag}(M_j) \mid M_j \in \text{GL}(d_j,\;\mathbb{K}), j=1,\dots,k \}. $$
Using the trivial global chart $\chi:\mathbb{R}^{n^2}\to G$ of $G$ one can see (after a rearranging of the basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$) that $P$ can be described by $$ P=\chi(\mathbb{R}^{n^2} \cap \{x_1=\dots=x_l=0\}) $$ where the coordinates set to zero are the ones outside the diagonal blocks. It follows by definition that $P$ is a submanifold of $G$, and applying Theorem 9.1 we conclude that $P$ is a closed subset of $G$. Obviously $P$ is a subgroup of $G$, hence a closed subgroup as required.


\section{Part C}
We can give $\mathpzc{F}$ a group structure by declaring $ \phi(g) \star \phi(h) = \phi(gh) $. The product $\star$ is well defined on the whole domain since from Part A it follows that $\phi$ is surjective, and it is defined in the right way to make $\phi$ a homomorphism of groups. We can then apply the isomorphism theorem for groups to conclude that such a bijection $\bar{\phi}$ is induced. 


\section{Part D}
To see tht $\phi(K)=\mathpzc{F}$ we look at what we did in Part A, and we observe that using the Grant-Schmidt process we can make all the $e_j$ and the $f_j$ orthonormal, thus making $g$ an orthogonal tranformation. Hence $\forall F \in \mathpzc{F}$ we can find a map $g\in K$ s.t. $\phi(g)=F$, or in other word $\phi(K)=\mathpzc{F}$. \\
From above it follows that the action of $K$ on $\mathpzc{F}$ is transitive, and it is clear that $ H = \text{ker}(\phi_{|K}) = K_E $. Hence we can apply Proposition 15.5 the get the desired diffeomorphism.\\
Finally we know that $K$ is compact and so it is its quotient $K/H$. Therefore $\F$ is compact.

\section{Part E}

\section{Part F}
Consider the set $ D=\{d\in\mathpzc{F} \mid d=(k,n-k)\} $, and define the map $$ \psi:D\to G_{n,k}(\mathbb{K}), \qquad d\mapsto F_1. $$ $\psi$ is surjective because $F_1$ can be any linear subspace of dimension $k$, and it is aswell injective because $F_2 = \mathbb{K}^n, F_0 = {0} $ and $F_1=F_1' \implies d=d'$.We covered the general case of $G_{n,k}(\mathbb{K})$, and the projective space is just the special case with $k=1$.
